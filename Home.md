# Welcome


## Features

This is a straight copy of source code from Nebular's git repo.- https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin.git

Ideally we should have forked this repo on git itself and add our custom code to it but since I can't host a private repo on github, I've copied the source as-is and will now be adding all the custom code on top of this.

This is modified and maintained by Swapnil, our UI developer who should and will document all the setup steps by editing this read me.

Things to do for Swapnil.

* Checkout this repo by using 
*        ```
*         $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/GWSDEVTEAM/nebular-lotus-admin-ui.git/wiki
*        ```
*  Go ahead and add all your custom code by modifying this source and make sure it works in all scenarios by thoroughly testing it. Once done add the changes from the root folder where you checked out this source code by.
*          ```
*         $ git add  . 
*        ```
*  After adding them, so git tracks, ensure you commit to your local repo by
*         ```
*         $ git commit -m "<Your commit message on what and why you're changing". 
*        ```
*  Now it's time to push this source to our remote repo and hence use
*         ```
*         $ git push 
*        ```
*  Once this is all done, we will checkout this source on our uat/staging server, run the required commands and run the node server to start this application which will then be available on 
 
If you've any issues you know where to find me!
